# Tools

A bunch of tools to help during the development of the PlayBall application

## Quick overview

- `git` folder has helper scripts to handle the amount of repositories used in this project
- `run` folder has helper scripts to get everything running a bit faster than going to all the projects folders to start each one
- `sln` folder contains solution files (`*.sln`) referencing multiple projects

## About the scripts

Every script has a couple of variants: Shell (e.g. Bash) and PowerShell (at least when I know how to do them ðŸ˜›).

You can use what makes more sense in your OS.

PowerShell does also run in MacOS and Linux. A simple way to get it, is to install it as a .NET global tool, like so: `dotnet tool install --global PowerShell`.
Then we can run it by typing in `pwsh` in a terminal.
